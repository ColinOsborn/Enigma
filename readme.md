# Enigma

* This project is supposed to replicate the Enigma machine used during World War II that encoded and decoded messages so that the enemy was not able to understand communication between forces. Here we are building that similar effect, only in Ruby!
* This unholy beast damn near made me quit Turing last time I attempted it. So this time, much like Jungle Beats, I had to give it another go so that way I could A) see the improvement in my programming and logic, and B) maybe reclaim some dignity.

* Project Spec = https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown
